## Reporting a Vulnerability

I have enabled **[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Racerx323/homelab-server-configs/security/advisories/new)** for this project. This is the preferred and most secure way to report a vulnerability.

When submitting your report, please provide as much detail as possible, including:

- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
- The version or commit hash affected.
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
- The potential impact of the vulnerability.

If for some reason you are unable to use GitHub's private reporting, you can send a confidential email to:

- **[aaronmanderson+github@proton.me](mailto:aaronmanderson+github@proton.me)**

## Our Commitment & Disclosure Process

As this is a project maintained in my spare time, please allow for some flexibility in the response timeline. I will do my best to adhere to the following process:

1. **Acknowledge**: I will aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within 3-5 business days.
2. **Validate**: I will work to validate the vulnerability. I may contact you for more information if needed.
3. **Remediate**: Once validated, I will work on a fix. The timeline for a fix can vary, but I will keep you informed of the progress.
4. **Disclose**: Once the fix is deployed, I will issue a GitHub Security Advisory and credit you for your discovery (unless you wish to remain anonymous).

## Safe Harbor

I consider security research and responsible disclosure performed in good faith to be a valuable and appreciated contribution. I will not take legal action against you for discovering and reporting security vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy.
