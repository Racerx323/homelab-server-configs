# Homelab Server Configs

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations to build and manage my home lab.

## 🚀 About This Project

This repository contains a collection of configuration files, scripts, and documentation to help automate the setup and management of my home lab servers. By using an Infrastructure as Code approach, you can create a reproducible, version-controlled, and easily scalable server environment.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Automated Setup**: Spend less time on manual configuration and more time experimenting.
* **Version Controlled**: Track changes to your infrastructure just like you track changes to your code.
* **Reproducible**: Easily recreate your entire environment on new hardware or after a system failure.
* **Scalable**: Add new services and servers with minimal effort.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Terraform**: For provisioning and managing infrastructure resources.
* **Docker Compose**: For defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
* **Bash/PowerShell Scripts**: For custom automation tasks.
